/*
Problem:  Write a program that keeps and manipulates a linked list of
	    String data. The data will be provided by the user one item at a time.
      The user should be able to do the following operations:
                     -add "String"
                                adds an item to your list (maintaining alphabetical order)
                     -remove "String"
                                if the item exists removes the first instance of it
                     -show
                                should display all items in the linked list
                     -clear
                               should clear the list
	Input:  commands listed above
	Output:  the results to the screen of each menu
	    choice, and error messages where appropriate.
